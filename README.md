PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This code demonstrates the implementation of an Employee Management System using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system consists of three main classes: Employee, Developer, and Manager, each with its own unique attributes and behaviors. The Employee class represents the basic employee, with properties such as name, title, and salary. The display_info() method allows for the easy display of an employee's information, while the give_raise() method enables the adjustment of an employee's salary. The Developer class is a specialized type of Employee, inheriting from the base Employee class. In addition to the basic employee properties, a Developer also has a list of programming languages they are proficient in. The display_info() method for Developer extends the base class implementation to include the list of programming languages. The Manager class is another specialized type of Employee, also inheriting from the base Employee class. A Manager has a list of employees that they manage. The add_employee() method allows for the addition of new employees to the manager's list, and the display_info() method includes the list of employees reporting to the manager.
